     G                  Em
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
C                     D
  The Lord took her away from me
G                               Em
  She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
   C                         D          G
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

        G                 Em
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
C                   D
  We hadn't driven very far
  G                   Em
There in the road, straight ahead
   C                      D
A car was stalled and the engine was dead
G                      Em
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right
      C                D
I'll never forget the sound that night
       G                  Em
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
     C                  D        G
The painful scream that I heard last

     G                  Em
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
C                     D
  The Lord took her away from me
G                               Em
  She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
   C                         D          G
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

     G                       Em
When I woke up the rain was pouring down
  C                        D
There were people standing all around
 G                            Em
Something warm was running through my eyes
 C                      D
But somehow I've found my baby that night
G                                          Em
I lifted her head, and when she looked at me and said
  C                      D
"Hold me darling just a little while!"
G                           Em
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
C                     D
I found the love that I knew I would miss
 G                        Em
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight
C                   D          G
I lost my love, my life, that night

     G                  Em
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
C                     D
  The Lord took her away from me
G                               Em
  She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
   C                         D          G
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
